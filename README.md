# Personal-Diary-Management-System

Welcome to the C Personal Diary Management System! This is a console application without graphics designed to help you keep track of your personal diary entries. With this system, you can add, view, edit, and delete entries, allowing you to effectively manage your personal thoughts and experiences.

## Functionality

The Personal Diary Management System offers the following main functions:

### 1. Add Entry

You can use the "add" function to create a new diary entry. Simply provide the required details such as the name, date, title, and content of your entry. The system will store this information securely and associate it with the date provided.

### 2. View Entry

The "view" function allows you to retrieve and read previously created diary entries. You can specify the date or title of the entry you want to view, and the system will display the relevant information on the screen. This function is useful for revisiting your past entries and reflecting on your experiences.

### 3. Edit Entry

If you want to make changes to a specific diary entry, you can utilize the "edit" function. Specify the date or title of the entry you wish to modify, and the system will present the existing content for you to update. You can then make any necessary changes to the entry and save the updated version.

### 4. Delete Entry

In case you no longer need a particular diary entry, the "delete" function enables you to remove it from the system. Simply provide the date or title of the entry you want to delete, and the system will permanently erase the associated information. Be cautious when using this function, as deleted entries cannot be recovered.
